What is Texy! software licensing model?
=======================================

Texy! uses a "dual licensing" business model. Users may choose to use Texy!
products under the free software GNU General Public License (GPL) or under a
commercial license.


GPL license
-----------

With the GPL license, Texy! is available free of charge and there is no
warranty. Users may download the software for free and modify, integrate and
distribute it. However, GPL users must abide by the rules of the GPL, which
stipulate that if a Texy!-based application is redistributed, the complete
source code for this application must also be open and available for
redistribution.


Commercial license
------------------

Author of Texy! David Grudl offers a commercial license for organizations that
do not want to release the source code for their application. David Grudl is
able to provide a commercial license because it has full ownership of the Texy!
code. The Texy! product is essentially identical under either the GPL license
or the commercial license.

Example: A company sells some kind of CMS system. If they were to use Texy!
in it's current state, they would have to release the portal software under the
GPL. A preferable solution for them would be to buy a commercial license and
thus be able to release their portal software (including Texy!) under a
commercial license.

And how much does a commercial Texy! license cost? Current pricing can be found

Why does Texy! offer two licenses?
----------------------------------

  - Texy! open source community gets superior software for no cost;

  - Texy! commercial customers have the option of using reliable, community
    "battle tested" Texy! software for a relatively low cost;

  - Texy! business is healthy and viable, which also strengthens the open source
    movement.
